1.This git repository was used to submit and get feedback for my course in web
programming know as comp20 for fall 2019.

2.My favorite assignment was the captain's log lab becuase I really liked 
working with local storage and just found how the data was saved to be really
interesting. I also feel like I learned a lot while doing it about javascript.

3.I think I have grown quite a bit since the start of this course. I have
learned so much about how the web works and about html and javascript. I have
also become much better at troubleshooting and problem solving when something
isn't working or when how to complete an assigment is unclear.

4.One of the most important things I have learned during this course
is just how the web actually works. Understanding the get, post and submit
requests has been really important in my understanding of how servers work. I 
have also found learning about html and the specific tags and styling aspects
is really important.It is the backbone of every web page and it is important
to know.

5.I would like to delve deeper into server stuff. I found assigment 3 really 
interesting writing the get and posts routes and I just think there is a lot
to learn when it comes to servers.
