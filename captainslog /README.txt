This project took me about 2 hours. I recieved help from TA's
and I refernced the comp20 github examples for use of
local storage.
This program saves the entries to localstorgare that are entered 
when the return key is hit. It saves the key as the time stamp and
the value as the message and the time appended togehter.
Then using the log id form the html, I loop through
existing localstoarge and add the values of each key to the log id
and then they are printed on the page when a referesh happens.
