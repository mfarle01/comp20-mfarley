1. For this lab I was able to implement a javascript function
that checks the time of the video provided and prints the lyrics
according to the if and else statements in the function.

2. I recieved help understanding git and github commands from a TA and
I referenced the example Ming posted on the comp20 github page.

3. I spent around 1.5 hours on this lab.
